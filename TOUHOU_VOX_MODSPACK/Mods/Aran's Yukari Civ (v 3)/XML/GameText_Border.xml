			<Text>The Domain is formless, endless, and within it lie all that has happened, that is happening, and that will happen.  Everything inside is both unique and identical at once, just as everything on Earth is different, yet part of the same world.  This split but singular aspect is what defines the Domain.  This is what the youkai Yakumo Yukari holds.  Within the chaos and disorder in this world, she has decided to call forth the Domain to unify those that are now separate.  It grows daily, accepting tens of thousands of beings from across all borders and all dimensions, garnering followers even here on Earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now you, Yakumo Yukari, leader and creator of the Domain, are tasked with building and directing them towards their victory.  Now is the time; tear every border down.  There shall only be one, unified boundary.</Text>

			<Text>The game has begun!  Yukari has started yet another one of her many games and has invited all in Gensokyo to join in the quest for glory and prestige.  Joining is simple, applicants create their own nation by filling out their form and posting it on their front door/porch/hill/cave/tree.  The purpose for this game is again, unknown, but who cares?  The prize for winning this competition of strategy, wit, and leadership is a favor from Yukari herself!  With that incentive, it seems few will be left out of the game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Created by the gap youkai Yakumo Yukari, the Domain of the Boundary has sit dormant for hundreds of years, silently watching and waiting.  Now, the time has come for them to rise up to fulfill their duty under their leader.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GAP_GENERATOR_PEDIA">
			<Text>The entire basis of the Domain centers around the Gap, so it was obvious that the Domain would take control of such a powerful tool.  Previously only usable by Yakumo Yukari, Gaps were used for instantaneous movement throughout the known reality, providing gateways to many different dimensions and universes.  Eventually, under the supervision of the border youkai herself, many enlightened beings learned to produce Gaps themselves.  This lead to the construction of the Gap Generators, enormous Gaps built in the heart of every city that linked up to form the Gap Transportation Network, allowing all to benefit from the Gapsâ€™ power.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GAP_GENERATOR_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Gap Generator is the Domain&apos;s second unique building, replacing the Airport.  The Generator provides instant transportation and communication between cities, increasing [ICON_CULTURE] Culture and [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great People generation by 10% and allowing most units to Airdrop to other Generators/Airports.  Through this portal, the boundaries of the Domain spread ever outwards, reducing the amount of [ICON_CULTURE] Culture required to acquire the next city tile by 50%.  It also provides +2 [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness because instant transportation is amazing.  After the discovery of Radar, the Gap Generator serves as the focal point for an actual airport, providing +2 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture and +1 [ICON_TOURISM] Tourism.</Text>

Lowers [ICON_CULTURE] Culture cost of new tiles by 50%.  After Radar, also grants additional [ICON_CULTURE] Culture and some [ICON_TOURISM] Tourism.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GAP_ARMORY_PEDIA">
			<Text>At first only usable by Yakumo Yukari, the Gap was something that many enlightened beings in the Domain strove to achieve.  With the development of reliable research methods, these beings succeeded in creating the first Gaps made by someone other than Yukari herself.  They then produced the portable self-Gapping device.  Drawing on the spirit energy of the user, this allowed any member of the Domain access to a transportation Gap link to wherever they pleased, provided that their destination was somewhere not too far away.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GAP_ARMORY_STRATEGY">
			<Text>The Gap Armory is the Domain&apos;s first unique building, replacing the Armory.  The Gap Armory is very expensive compared to the regular Armory, costing vastly more [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production and [ICON_GOLD] Gold to build and maintain, even though it gives only half the experience.  Regardless of its cost, granting every unit the ability to jump from friendly lands into advanced combat positions or hard-to-reach enemy territories is extremely useful.  This building spreads the Domain&apos;s influence, reducing the [ICON_CULTURE] Culture cost of new tiles by 15%.  Build only in your unit production cities to mitigate its cost.</Text>
