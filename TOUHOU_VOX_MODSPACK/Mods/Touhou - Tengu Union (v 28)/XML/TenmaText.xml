				Hail mighty Tenma, ruler of all tengu and mountains. The many races of the tengu bow before your name.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The mountain where you stand to rule was onced ruled by the oni. However, due to the creation of the Great Hakurei Barrier and the rapid decline of dedicated oni exterminators, the oni grew tired of how uneventful Gensokyo had become and left the mountain. With your superiors nowhere to be found, you were quick to lead your people to build upon what was left by the oni. Ever since then, your people have made an advanced civilization that has become the envy of many humans and youkai alike.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lady Tenma, will you continue to rule the skies? Will you make sure that all tengu is prideful of their race, while the others look up to them? Will you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?

			<Text>The tengu of Gensokyo are known for their love of gossip and writing newspapers. Their reporters enjoy rumormongering and paparazzi photography. What&apos;s even more frightening is that they&apos;ll spread half-truths and weird rumors. There are cases where the tengus&apos; rumors will literally become the wind&apos;s rumors that they even reached human ears. Thereby, it becomes difficult to properly notify the village otherwise. Because this is something against which there is no complete defense, there is nothing more dreadful than this.</Text>

				"What's 'punk'? It's an explosion of oppressed frustration! The roar of the soul!"
				[NEWLINE]This was the explanation provided by Ms. Kyouko. I then asked her what exactly her "oppressed frustration" was.
				[NEWLINE]"Well, all I ever do is clean and recite sutras all day, you know? Sitting in the lotus position hurts a lot too."

				"Living in every human's body are bugs called the three worms. On the night of gengshen they sneak out of your body and report your sins to the Lord of Heaven, thereby reducing your lifespan. So, if you stay awake and alert on gengshen, you can prevent having your sins revealed and therefore preserve your life."
				[NEWLINE]She claims this is the reason why people started to have parties on that day.
				[NEWLINE]"But everyone just gets dead drunk in today's parties, and the bugs get out anyway, completely ruining the point. That's why I developed 'The Four Wise Monkeys'. With these, you can easily live longer than even the most devout monk. Indeed, you could say they're for monk-ease."

				[NEWLINE]Says Ms. Moriya Suwako (goddess), who is connected to the Geyser Center. Magma is another word for "Divine Oni Spring", said to be so hot that the oni bathe in it. Though plentiful in Hell, magma is seldom found on the surface.
				[NEWLINE]"It has nothing to do with an eruption. Even if something like that happens, I'll adjust the date, so...."

				[NEWLINE]These were the words of the suspicious woman in question, Hinanawi Tenshi (Celestial). According to her, it was not a weather forecast but a personality assessment.
				[NEWLINE]"Haven't you ever heard of someone having a sunny or cloudy disposition? It happens to rain or clear up when they're there, sort of... Humans can manipulate the weather like that and I can see the effects. So my personality assessment is equivalent to a weather forecast."

				These maidens lose their veil near the human village on purpose to lure a potential partner. If they take a fancy to the gentleman who finds their veil, they tell him they cannot return to heaven so they insist on marrying him. If they don't, they simply swipe it back. However, is this method really acceptable?
				[NEWLINE]Nagae Iku (Messenger of the Dragon Palace) had this to say on the matter:
				[NEWLINE]""Husband-hunting veils"? Oh yes, I heard that kind of thing has become popular with the more tawdry maidens. However, these veils are provided by the Lord of Heaven, so we have to write an apology letter if we damage or lose it. To be perfectly honest, the only ones who participate in such absurdity are fools who do not consider the consequences."

				[NEWLINE]Though she says that, she is devoted to making more rules to utilize the new pieces.
				[NEWLINE]"I want to see how shogi in the outside world has evolved with my own eyes. There is the possibility that the rules have been simplified, since all of the new pieces which were found couldn't be promoted. In that case, we tengu would likely find it lacking."

				"The rumbling was so strong, I almost felt like I was being tossed around. Then, in an instant, the roof caved in on the shrine and wrecked it!"
				[NEWLINE]The shrine did not seem to have been struck by a strong force from the outside, nor did it not look like it was destroyed by a power other than an earthquake. There were no obvious cracks or faults visible nearby, so perhaps it was the doing of a relatively small giant catfish.
				[NEWLINE]The shrine was was a fairly old building, so it was fortunate that the shrine's roof simply fell upon it. That makes it much simpler to rebuild. However, even if the shrine is repaired, if the reason for the collapse remains unknown then the same thing might happen again. Basically, that earthquake seemed suspicious, as if it were caused on purpose.

				Kirisame Marisa (Human) was the one who was at the end of our path. What will happen if we match a fairy drunk on her own power against a human who often hangs out with fairies? That was my observation at the time.
				[NEWLINE]"This'll be good. Lessee how entertainin' a fairy as my opponent could possibly be!"
				[NEWLINE]A show between a human drunk on alcohol and a fairy drunk on power began. Although there was nothing special to report in this silly play-fight, it was quite impressive to see how Marisa enjoyed taking it easy on the fairy. The fact that she wasn't using her specialty, her famous lasers, made it even more amusing.

				The kappa remain aggressive, claiming that, "If the nets are hurting anyone, we will just modify them so they don't; we still have the right to catch mist!"
				[NEWLINE]In response, Ms. Ibaraki replied:
				[NEWLINE]"We don't only eat mist. And even when we do, it's simple enough to gather some on our own... I mean, who would have to buy something like that?"
				[NEWLINE]The conclusion of the conference was: "Nets which affect flying creatures will be banned.". Shortly after, it seems that the kappa developed an improved mist net which will only catch mist. However, there is a widespread belief that the price of mist will not increase significantly and the sales of the nets will decrease. Despite this, the technology to catch mist efficiently may be used elsewhere in the future.

				"This corpse says she's not really planning on harming anyone, you see."
				[NEWLINE]The interpreter is Kaenbyou Rin (Kasha), an expert on the dead. There is no one that can handle the treatment of human corpses better than her.
				[NEWLINE]"Her name is Miyako Yoshika. She says she doesn't remember much more than that, and that she suddenly got the feeling that she really needed to defend this place no matter what. I think that her obsessions from her past life made her uneasy, and caused her corpse to be reanimated. I've narrowed down her territory a bit, so if it's not a problem you can probably just leave her here to rot!"

				[NEWLINE]The fireball and ten-shaku alien were just an act to keep people away.
				[NEWLINE]"I was just trying to look like a "scary unidentified object". I heard people were starting to say there was an alien running around beforehand, so that rumor just kind of ended up making me out to be that alien on its own. But, a 10 shaku tall alien, you say?"

				The youkai expert, Ms. Yakumo Yukari said:
				[NEWLINE]"Well, I suppose it was an act by the youkai of the underground. Since their powers come from the negative energy of humans, maybe she wanted to scare humans who had become too peace-addled."
				[NEWLINE]There is a nonintervention pact made between the youkai of the underground and the surface, so if this was the work of the youkai underground, the situation could become complicated. Even we tengu hope to avoid trouble with the underground.
				[NEWLINE]"However, since we don't have the all-important skeleton, it could have been a simple misunderstanding. No, it was a misunderstanding, definitely."

				Ms. Kaku Seiga (hermit) seeks to make a business out of this fad. She says that with her ability to go through walls at will, she is planning to sneak into human houses.
				[NEWLINE]"During Christmas, everyone buys toys from Santa Claus (St. Nicholas), and he sneaks in to deliver them. That's how it works in the outside world. I guess it's an event that gathers faith from children."
				[NEWLINE]But Seiga claims that it isn't enough:
				[NEWLINE]"Why should we believe in some white-beard old man, especially when we don't even know if he's in Gensokyo in the first place? That's why everyone has such a hard time selling toys. So, I decided that I'm going to sell the toys directly to the owner, or, if they're asleep, I'll just take something that looks valuable."

				The individual behind this trend, Kagiyama Hina (Misfortune God), explains:
				[NEWLINE]"Extravagant hina dolls being traditional is just plain nonsense. Sturdy dolls made by the poor to last many years are what became the fancy hina dolls you see today. The truth is that you're supposed to throw the dolls away after filling them with misfortune."
				[NEWLINE]The new hina dolls are made to be disposable. Once the Hina Festival is over, the dolls simply float down the river.
				[NEWLINE]"Humans who thought 'Letting these dolls be carried away by the river is such a waste' are the ones who made hina dolls into what they are now. As an unfortunate result, they no longer accomplish the original goal of cleansing. This has caused misfortune to slowly gather in the human village. If that's not discarded quickly, my power will..."

				"What, you don't know? A babysitter's job is to fly through the sky with an umbrella."
				[NEWLINE]A karakasa obake is a type of Tsukumogami. An umbrella neglected for many years, she eventually turned into a youkai. She is a fairly classic type that exists to trouble humans. However, its connection to babysitting is vague at best.
				[NEWLINE]"I don't really get the whole picture, but in the outside world, babysitters fly through the sky using an umbrella. When I heard of that, I decided to take a shot at it myself. I mean, children are pretty easy to scare. "

				"I'm sick of these pointless objections from the white wolf tengu. It's not like we're going to wreak havoc on the mountain. In fact, it will help provide more faith to the mountain, which will then also increase their own power. I can't help but think that they are just trying to justify not going outside more than the absolute minimum required. This is why I hate those hikikomori."
				[NEWLINE]In response to this, the white wolf tengu replied curtly, "It is our duty to remain alert for intruders."
				[NEWLINE]As it is right now, worshipers praying at the Moriya Shrine is a rare occurrence. One of the reasons for this are the patrolling white wolf tengu. Seeing no way around them, Moriya established a branch shrine in the foothills to allow people to come and pray, as well as to be able to conduct business themselves and gather faith from humans.

				"The path of Buddhism is training to attain enlightenment. In other words, it involves exorcising evil spirits from the human soul. However, our Buddhist service is specially tailored for youkai, so..."
				[NEWLINE]She may have been attempting to say that the very act of a youkai attending a Buddhist service would be like them denying their own existence, as they are an aspect of the evil lurking in the human soul. That indeed sounds like a thrill.
				[NEWLINE]But Ms. Hijiri continues:
				[NEWLINE]"The state of enlightenment is "Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form", thus it is said to be a substance which is born by itself from the flawless soul. It may be that youkai are actually close to enlightenment, since the denial of self is directly connected to the denial of existence."
